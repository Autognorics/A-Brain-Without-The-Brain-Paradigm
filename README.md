# A Brain Without The Brain Paradigm
[HOME](https://autognorics.github.io/) 

In his book, Biotronics: The Silver Species, Joey Lawsin disclosed his theory on Aneural Consciousness that claims Consciousness does not need to emerge from the Brain. He called this idea as A Brain without the Brain Paradigm. Short excerpts from his book that reveal some of his findings of this paradigm are discussed in the preceding lines.

Perhaps, sometime during your childhood days, you playfully send messages through a friend using a string telephone, a toy which is made up of two tin cans that are connected by a long string.  When information is sent through the first can, the information travels to the string and receives by the second can. The simple telephone setup depicts a model of what a system is and what it is made up of.

In any system, there are always six major components present. Technically, they are the incoming message called the input, the flowing message called the medium, and the outgoing message called the output. In addition, the first can, where the input enters, is called the collector; the string, where the medium flows, is called the carrier; and the other can, where the output leaves, is called the actuator. However, the trigger, an external source, is the seventh and most important element in the system.

Also, the six major elements of a system can be divided into two parts. The input, medium, and output are the first part of the system; while, the collector, carrier, and actuator are the second part. The first parts are all by-materials while the second parts are all material objects. All materials and by-materials combined are singularly called Physicals. This concept of material and by-material is one of the most important aspects of understanding a system.

For example, in the Basic Aneural System drawing below, the switch serves as the collector, the wires as the carrier, and the light bulb as the actuated. The input signal comes from the switch, then flows into the medium, and releases as output (e.g. light). On the other hand, the battery in the illustration serves only as the energy source to make the system alive. Here, the stored information is triggered by an external source, collected as input, processed either on or off, and sent as output without using any neuron or brain. The information is stored and processed in the switch as On or Off. The two units of information can also be represented as 0 or 1, Dit or Dah, Up or Down, Black or white, or shell or twig.

Some examples of the linear aneural work systems of intuitive networks that stores and processes information in a queue without a brain and its six major elements are illustrated below:

"Just because you have a brain doesn't mean you are conscious;
just because you are alive doesn't mean you have a brain."
